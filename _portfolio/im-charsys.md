### A web app, December 2015 - March 2016
#### [View on Github](https://github.com/stephmarx/infinite-mysteries-charsys) | [Live Site](http://characters.infinitemysteries.com/)

<p>A Ruby on Rails application used to manage characters and faciliate character creation for the Infinite Mysteries roleplaying game system. This application is still in development and is a collaboration between myself and another Rails developer. </p>
<p>I designed the user interface for this site and coded the front end, as well as assisting on database design and back end implementation with Rails. This site uses SLIM, Sass, and jQuery and is free of front end frameworks.</p>
