<p>Web Accessibility 101 is a presentation created to introduce developers with some knowledge of HTML/CSS to web accessibility concepts. It was presented at Chicago Code Camp 2016 on April 30, 2016 at the Illinois Institute of Technology. <a href="http://www.decksetapp.com/">Deckset</a> was used to generate presentation slides from my markdown notes, and I absolutely love it.</p>
<p>The abstract for this talked <a href="http://chicagocodecamp.com/sessions/detail/1124">was published</a> as: </p>
<p>What if you had launched a new website, and due to an error in code, 1 in 5 users couldn't access it? This isn't hyperbole; 1 in 5 Americans live with a disability. Furthermore, studies show that people with disabilities are significantly less likely than adults without disabilities to go online at all. As technology has grown, using the web has shifted from being a luxury to being a necessity, so accessible web sites are of paramount importance. In this talk, we'll discuss the basics of how to accommodate users with a wide variety of disabilities, such as visual impairment, dyslexia, and vestibular disorders. This talk assumes a basic knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3, and discusses both code and visual design.</p>
