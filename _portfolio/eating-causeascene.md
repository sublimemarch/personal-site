In this talk, I cover my personal experiences as a person with disordered eating, problems with eating and food in the tech industry, and how others can help make space for those with dietary restrictions. I also created a mini zine with the action items from this talk, which is available in [print](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mbPVBRlg6fGw-qW3uaDBxESM5OlX1-0W/view?usp=sharing) and [digital](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_HCN0FCcNB5Pjafw6oFt9RXXlK10nS-O) formats.
